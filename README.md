# Project Ka-Akbay
AI-Powered Chatbots for Psychoeducation and Triage: GenAI can power sophisticated chatbots that provide accurate information about mental health conditions, self-help strategies, and available resources in local languages (Tagalog, Cebuano, etc.). 

## Goals
These bots can act as a first point of contact, offering anonymous support, basic coping mechanisms, and guidance on when and where to seek professional help, thereby reducing initial barriers like stigma and cost.

1. Make a fork and make a pull request. I'll review it in my spare time
