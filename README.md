# Project Ka-Akbay
AI-Powered Chatbots for Psychoeducation and Triage:
## Goals
These bots can act as a first point of contact, offering anonymous support, basic coping mechanisms, and guidance on when and where to seek professional help, thereby reducing initial barriers like stigma and cost.

The current aim is to build chatbots that provide accurate information about mental health conditions, self-help strategies, and available resources in local languages (Tagalog, Cebuano, etc.).
