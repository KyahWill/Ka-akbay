# Project Ka-Akbay
AI-Powered Chatbots for Psychoeducation and Triage: GenAI can power sophisticated chatbots that provide accurate information about mental health conditions, self-help strategies, and available resources in local languages (Tagalog, Cebuano, etc.). 

## Goals
These bots can act as a first point of contact, offering anonymous support, basic coping mechanisms, and guidance on when and where to seek professional help, thereby reducing initial barriers like stigma and cost.

## Target User Groups & Their Needs:
1. Individuals in Crisis (IIC)
2. Hesitant or Curious Individuals (HCI)I
3. Concerned Loved Ones (CLO)

### Individuals in Crisis (IIC) (Displaying severe symptoms, needing self-assessment for urgency, and clear pathways to immediate help. Primarily uses the app for urgent triage and resource finding.)
As an Individual in Crisis experiencing intense distress (e.g., severe panic, thoughts of self-harm), I want to quickly describe or select my severe symptoms in the chatbot (in Tagalog or English), so that I can understand the potential seriousness of my situation and if I need immediate professional help.
As an Individual in Crisis feeling overwhelmed and unsafe, I want to be immediately provided with 24/7 crisis hotline numbers and clear instructions on how to contact emergency mental health services in the Philippines, so that I can get immediate support and ensure my safety.
As an Individual in Crisis needing urgent care, I want to get a list of nearby hospitals or clinics with emergency psychiatric services, including their location and contact details, so that I or someone with me can find professional help without delay.
As an Individual in Crisis who is scared and unsure, I want the chatbot to guide me through a simple, calming interaction that helps assess my immediate risk, so that I can get clear, direct advice on the next essential step for my safety.

### Hesitant or Curious Individuals (HCI) (Exploring mental health out of curiosity or a vague sense of unease/mild symptoms. Values anonymity, information, and self-help options before committing to professional help.)
As a Hesitant Individual feeling unsure about my persistent low mood or anxiety, I want to anonymously explore information about common mental health conditions like depression and anxiety in simple Tagalog or English, so that I can understand what these conditions are without feeling pressured or identified.
As a Curious Individual, I want to ask the chatbot general questions about mental well-being, stress management, and healthy coping mechanisms, so that I can learn ways to improve my overall mental health proactively.
As a Hesitant Individual experiencing mild, concerning symptoms, I want to use an interactive tool within the chatbot to gently assess my feelings and behaviors privately, so that I can get some perspective on whether I might benefit from further support without immediate commitment.
As a Hesitant Individual not ready for face-to-face help, I want to learn about basic, actionable self-help strategies (like simple mindfulness exercises or journaling prompts) from the chatbot, so that I can try to manage my feelings on my own first.
As a Hesitant Individual, I want to be able to ask the chatbot about the different types of mental health support available in the Philippines (e.g., counseling, therapy, support groups) and what to expect, so that I can make a more informed decision if I choose to seek help later.

### Concerned Loved Ones (CLO) (Noticing concerning behaviors in a friend or family member. Uses the app to understand the situation, learn how to offer support, and find resources for their loved one â€“ essentially triaging for someone else.)
As a Concerned Loved One noticing changes in my friend's behavior (e.g., withdrawal, irritability), I want to learn about potential signs and symptoms of common mental health issues in Tagalog or English, so that I can better understand what they might be experiencing.
As a Concerned Loved One unsure how to help my family member, I want to get advice from the chatbot on how to start a supportive conversation with them about their mental health, so that I can offer help without making them feel uncomfortable or judged.
As a Concerned Loved One, I want to find information on accessible and appropriate mental health services, clinics, or professionals in the Philippines that I can suggest to my loved one, so that they have concrete options if they are willing to seek help.
As a Concerned Loved One worried that my loved one might be in immediate danger, I want to get clear guidance from the chatbot on how to assess the urgency and what steps to take to ensure their safety, including when and how to contact emergency services for them.
As a Concerned Loved One, I want to learn about support groups or resources available for families and caregivers of individuals with mental health conditions, so that I can also get support for myself and learn how to cope.
